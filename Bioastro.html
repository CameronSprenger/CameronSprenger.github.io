										<h3>Tilt-Translation Sled (TTS)</h3>
										
										</p>
									</header>
									<p>The Tilt-Translation Sled is a device donated by the Neuroscience Laboratory of NASA Johnson Space Center. 
										It is capable of administering motions in the roll tilt and X-axis translation. The goal of the experiment is to measure 
										spatial awareness relying solely on their vestibular senses over the duration of a motion profile. Motion stimuli can be 
										administered in a variety of profiles (i.e. sinusoidal, sigmoidal, etc.) and at various frequencies.

										I joined this project a few years into its lifetime so my role was focused on development and maintainance of the sub-systems. 
										In an effort to expand the testing capabilities of the TTS, I was in charge of the addition of a modular input device that collects 
										user data during the duration of the experiment. There were preexisting 1/2" threaded holes that supported all-thread over the subject head. 
										I used these as a structural base for a tablet running test software the subject interacts with. I was only given a few constraints 
										and considerations to work within, so I had to create a design from sctratch. One of my main focuses when I was in the early 
										stages of ideating was the work flow and ease of use. The point of the device was to be quickly changed back and forth between experiments 
										so I had to consider rapid mounting solutions.
