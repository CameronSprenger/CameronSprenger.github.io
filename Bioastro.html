									</header>
									<p>As part of a graduate product design course, I was tasked with designing something that was aesthetically beautiful
										regardless of functionality. I decided on creating a headphone amplifier that used the Swiss style of watchmaking
										known as côtes de Genève, or Geneva Stripes to blend my Swiss hetitage and my passion for audio gear into something 
										beautiful I could enjoy for many many years. And yes, it is very functional.</br> </br> High end audio, past a certain point,
										is all about the grandeur and presence in a room. If you are going to be spending upwards of ten of thousand 
										dollars on something, you want it to be beautiful, and you want it to be seen. So, I thought drawing inspiration from 
										Swiss watches would blend together nicely and compliment one another. Since I'd always appreciated the intricacy and complexity 
										of mechanical Swiss watches, I felt it was a nice way to tie the two together.    </p>
